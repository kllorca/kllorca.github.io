I am a librarian at the <a title="CUNY Graduate Center website" href="https://gc.cuny.edu/Home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CUNY Graduate Center</a> working with graduate student research methods and electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs). I study the intersection of digital humanities and academic librarianship, with an emphasis on scholarly communication, copyright, graduate student research, and digital dissertations. My current research includes work on digital scholarly editions and digital archives, librarianship as a feminized profession, and digital dissertations.

I&#8217;m a founding co-editor of [_dh+lib_](https://acrl.ala.org/dh) (&#8220;where the digital humanities and librarianship meet&#8221;), an online publication and collaborative project sponsored by the Association of College & Research Libraries (ACRL). We recently produced a special issue, &#8220;[Digital Humanities in the Library / Of the Library](https://acrl.ala.org/dh/2016-special-issue/),&#8221; including ten original essays contributed by scholars and practitioners from across the field.

I earned my MSLIS from <a title="Pratt SILS" href="https://www.pratt.edu/academics/information_and_library_sciences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pratt Institute</a>, with an Advanced Certificate in Archives. My concentration was in special collections, with coursework comprising technical services, conservation, reference and outreach for library and archival materials in print, audiovisual, photographic and digital formats.

My previous career was in academic bookstores and publishing.
