I am a librarian at the <a title="CUNY Graduate Center website" href="https://gc.cuny.edu/Home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CUNY Graduate Center</a>, where I also serve as project director for the [CUNY Digital History Archive](https://cdha.cuny.edu) and oversee the college's institutional archives. I work with electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) and study the intersection of digital humanities and academic librarianship with an emphasis on scholarly communication, copyright, graduate student research, and digital dissertations. My current project is a history of activist librarians at CUNY.

I was a founding co-editor of [_dh+lib_](https://acrl.ala.org/dh) (&#8220;where the digital humanities and librarianship meet&#8221;), and have taught digital humanities at Pratt Instituteâ€™s School of Information. My research focuses on digital scholarship and archives, academic labor, and librarianship as a feminized profession and has appeared in _Journal of Librarianship and Scholarly Communication_, _Library Trends_, and _College & Research Libraries_. I hold a BA in Film Studies from the University of California, Berkeley, an MA in Liberal Studies from the CUNY Graduate Center, and an MSLIS with Archives Certificate from Pratt Institute. 

My previous career was in academic bookstores and publishing.
