The history of social justice activism within librarianship is well-studied, but few have looked at
the role of librarians at CUNY as drivers of political and social change within the profession.
Many know that the famed poet Audre Lorde worked as a librarian while an undergraduate at
Hunter College in the 1950s before obtaining her library degree from Columbia University, but
the history of CUNY libraries and the contributions of its librarians extend well beyond such
icons. For example, CUNY librarians were especially active in the formation of the ALAâ€™s
groundbreaking Social Responsibilities Round Table (SRRT) in 1969 and the Feminist Task
Force in 1970, and several have been referenced in relation to national movements in
librarianship, especially during the Vietnam era.[^1] While some individual profiles exist, there is
no existing scholarship on the many activist librarians at CUNY as a group, nor is there any
examination of the ways in which being at CUNY influenced their activism.

This history will situate the stories of individual librarians within the activist tradition of CUNY
faculty and students as they responded to everything from the social upheaval of the Vietnam era
to the tumultuous shifts occurring at their own institution with open admissions, and beyond.
