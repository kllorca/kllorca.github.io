We are working to compile a dataset of projects referenced in the [_Debates in the Digital Humanities_](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/) book series edited by Matthew K. Gold and Lauren F. Klein. Most scholarly digital projects are not well represented in library discovery systems despite being openly available online; integrating them with with more conventional forms of scholarship like books and journal articles may increase their use by those less familiar with DH. We also feel that the _Debates in the Digital Humanities_ series offers rich possibilities to consider how digital humanities scholarship—and what is cited by its practitioners and theorists—has changed as the field evolves. We intend for the Debates in DH Digital Project Index to serve as both a dataset and discovery tool.
