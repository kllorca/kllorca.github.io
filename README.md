This site was built with Jekyll, using [Celeste](https://github.com/nicoelayda/celeste) as the basis. Celeste is based on [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), the Jekyll butler. I honestly don't know what that means yet, but I am picturing Tim Curry in *Clue* serving me a website. Most of the design comes from this basis, but I tweaked the typography, line-spacing, and content width (I like to play around with the [Golden Ratio Calculator](https://grtcalculator.com/)). I've tried getting set up with Jekyll in the past and went down a few different rabbit holes of complex themes that promised a lot of features but also required digging through a lot of circular documentation! It turns out I wanted a simple site with a clean look and Celeste made this possible.

For the landing page, however, I borrowed heavily from the [Jekyll Academic theme](https://github.com/gaalcaras/academic), by Gabriel Alcaras. I wanted the profile pic and contact information front and center and I liked the overall design of this theme. Unfortunately, the theme repository hadn't been updated for a few years and I was a bit worried that there might be issues down the road, so I stuck with the simple vanilla Jekyll and recreated the look in my own layouts.

With Celeste, however, there wasn't any mobile menu built into the default layout. I was able to fudge something together using the [Toggle Menu](https://jekyllcodex.org/without-plugin/toggle-menu/) script from the Jekyll Codex site. It's not perfect, but it will do.

Another tweak was adding previous and next post links to the bottom of the blog post pages. Celeste had pagination links on the posts index page, but once you opened up a full post there was no way to cycle through other posts without returning to the main blog page. These [instructions from bytedude](https://www.bytedude.com/jekyll-previous-and-next-posts/) worked perfectly!

I relied on the documentation for the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme to help me understand how to think about includes and layouts, and it pointed me towards using Jekyll's collection feature for my projects page. I borrowed the "teaser" label for assigning thumbnails, and was able to set a default image for projects in the config.yml file. I also learned a little about [CSS grids](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-css-grid-layout/) by trying to recreate those feature rows, and am now also inching closer towards conversance with SASS. 

Finally, I added Twitter Card metadata and DublinCore metadata for Zotero, for which I drew upon the head.html file in the [Ed theme](https://github.com/minicomp/ed/blob/main/_includes/head.html).
